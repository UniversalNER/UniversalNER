Multilingual NLP needs high quality Named Entity Recognition datasets 
in many languages with a shared tagset. This project aims to build that.


UNER is modeled after the [Universal Dependencies](https://universaldependencies.org/) project,
with the goal of defining a shared tagset, and engaging community involvement. Ultimately,
we hope to have a large multilingual NER dataset than will fuel a new generation 
of multi- and cross-lingual NER research.

 
Quick start:
 - [Annotation guidelines and tagset](guidelines/)
 - [Annotation software](https://annotate.universalner.org/)
