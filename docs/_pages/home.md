Universal Named Entity Recognition (UNER) aims to fill a gap in multilingual NLP: high quality NER datasets 
in many languages with a shared tagset.

UNER is modeled after the [Universal Dependencies](https://universaldependencies.org/) project, in that
it is intended to be a large community annotation effort with language-universal guidelines. Further, we use the _same text corpora_ as Universal Dependencies.
